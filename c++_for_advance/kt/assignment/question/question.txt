1, write a c++ program for LOG class and should use a "enum" for loglevel.

    -> 4 log level
        -> VERBOS 
        -> INFO
        -> Warn
        -> ERROR

    1,a when we creat a object we should be able to (select the log  level)
    1,b default it should be set to "ERROR".

write your own INT_(8bit) with error handling. (eg : stop overflow)
write your own string class (by only c style string ,eg : strlen())
write a program to keep track of you heap memory. 
creat you own array class called "array" in stack memory.(hint: template)
