/* 
**Advantages of foreach loop
It eliminates the possibility of errors and makes the code more readable.
Easy to implement
Does not require pre-initialization of the iterator

** Disadvantages of foreach loop
Cannot directly access the corresponding element indices
Cannot traverse the elements in reverse order
It doesnâ€™t allow the user to skip any element as it traverses over each one of them
